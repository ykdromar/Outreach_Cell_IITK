          [For Y18 and Y19 students] Greetings from the Outreach Cell, IIT
          Kanpur! With a fresh counselling season knocking on our doors, we have
          a new batch of students ready to take on one of the most
          experience-driven journeys of their lives. Yes! We're talking about
          the upcoming Y21 batch. IIT Kanpur has always believed in harmonious
          and fulfilling campus culture, and our Campus Junta is like our second
          family thus we always look out for each other, even before they become
          part of this extended family. In the same spirit, we bring to you the
          Open House Sessions. This event looks forward to make the upcoming
          batch familiar with the academic culture of IIT Kanpur, and their
          seniors will conduct 30-40 minute sessions in their respective
          coaching centers and guide prospective candidates on the teaching
          patterns, academic behavior, insights on what their preferred
          department has to offer, and the life at IIT Kanpur campus. Since it
          would be an interactive session, you would be addressing their
          relevant doubts which in the future could play a deciding part in
          determining their choices while filling the counselling preferences.
          Please keep in mind that when you're in the session you would be the
          voice and ears of IIT Kanpur, you can motivate students in ways that
          can not only define their college and career, but also the reputation
          of our institute. We hope to see your registrations in large numbers.
